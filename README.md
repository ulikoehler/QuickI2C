# QuickI2C

Practical Arduino Wire I2C wrapper, allowing direct register access with proper error handling.

This is intended to be similar to [AdaFruit BusIO](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_BusIO) but provide a more convenient API and less memory footprint. For example, every [Adafruit_BusIO_Register](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_BusIO/blob/master/Adafruit_BusIO_Register.h) is an actual object occupying a bunch of bytes of RAM and does not provide verified read functionality.
